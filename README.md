This is the final project for React Nanodegree (React Native)

I tested my app on an iOS Emulator: iPhone 11
To install the dependencies, please run

`npm install`

`cd ios`

`pod install`

`yarn ios`

This will start the ios emulator with the app. You should see the app asking for permission to show local notifications. Every day at 8 pm, if the user hasn't answered one quiz, the app will show a reminder notification.

Functionality:
* Create a Deck
* Add Questions
* See Results
* Use the app as a flashcard app
* Restart Quiz
